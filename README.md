DTF Gathering Scripts

These scripts brought to you by our sponsors AnTifa, The Gays, and cultural marxism.





Basic Construction & Structure

Our scripts contain the following components:

Starting logic to start the rail

The core mining or lumberjacking loop which mines or lumberjacks until resources are depleted

Code to either use a Rope or cast Teleport

The absolute coordinate for the next position in the rail.

Exiting logic to end the rail, go home, and deposit resources


Using these components we can build a rail that follows the below structure:

startlogic

miningloop

ropeortele

nextpositioncoordinate

startlogic

miningloop

ropeortele

nextpositioncoordinate

...

miningloop

ropeortele

nextpositioncoordinate

exitlogic




 RAZOR CONFIGURATION

Our rails require the following configurations in razor:

Organizer 6 must be set to boards and ore.

‘Filter repeating system messages must be OFF’

Object Delay must be 600 ms
